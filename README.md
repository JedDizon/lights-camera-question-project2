## Bugs 

See below the main bugs I found throughout the development process:

  - Can't get all buttons to start the game with the class of "genre-btn".
    - FIX: Had startGame(this) instead of startGame(button).

  - Couldnt get next button to work.
    - FIX: Used devtools to check with console log that I have correct ids logged. Found I had duplicated the IDs; removed duplicate. Also wrapped entire script in domcontent loaded. 

  - Quiz answers kept showing up in position 1 (always at the same place).
    - FIX: Tried to at first manually move the position of the correct answers. Instead found that creating a function to randomise questions was a better idea. 

  - Found out that users can pick a different answer after notification of answer correct/incorrect.
    - FIX: Created a function to disable answer buttons from doing anything.

  - Users can skip to the end of the quiz without choosing an answer. 
    - FIX: Create event listener to ensure user chooses an snwer first before hitting next.
